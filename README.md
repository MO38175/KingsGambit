# KingsGambit

KingsGambit is a data visualization project for chess!

## Getting Installed

KingsGambit was built using Python3, specifically version 3.10.6. Before you get started ensure you have Python3 installed. If you do not have Python3 installed you can do so [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).</br>

<p>
Once Python3 is installed you can start to install the packages KingsGambit uses. You will need to install the following packages.
<ul>
  <li>Chess (https://pypi.org/project/chess/)</li>
  <li>Pillow (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)</li>
  <li>CairoSVG (https://pypi.org/project/CairoSVG/)</li>
  <li>Tkinter</li>
</ul>
Tkinter requires a display for the program to work correctly. If you do not have one installed I used [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) during testing.

## Using KingsGambit

To try out the project navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository and run the command `python3 beta.py`. This will create window AND a task in the terminal. If either are close the entire program will close so be careful. You interact with the program using keyboard inputs in the terminal, and data is visualized in the window according to your inputs.
